--What is it JSX?--
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. 
It is commonly used with React to describe what the UI should look like. 
JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React applications by converting HTML tags into React elements.


--Set up of the app--
-->import React from "react";
//This imports the React library, which is essential for writing JSX

-->import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
/*This imports the ReactDOM client API, introduced in React 18.

It gives you access to createRoot(), which replaces the older ReactDOM.render() method.

This is part of React’s move toward concurrent rendering and better performance.*/

-->const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
/*This finds the HTML element with the ID root — usually defined in your index.html like:<div id="root"></div>

Then it creates a React root inside that element, which is where your React app will live.

This is the new way to initialize rendering in React 18+.*/

-->root.render(
  <div>
    <h1>Hello Marcelo!!</h1>
    <p>This is my paragraph</p>
  </div>
);
//Using div I can write sevrela html elements in one element, making this work.

/*This tells React to render the JSX <h1>Hello Marcelo!!</h1> inside the root element.

JSX is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code in JavaScript.

Under the hood, React converts this into virtual DOM instructions and efficiently updates the real DOM.*/
