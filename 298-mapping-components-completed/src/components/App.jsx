Key ID:
‚û°Ô∏èA warning appears in the console: "Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' property." This warning persists even after refreshing the browser, indicating a real issue rather than a CodeSandbox glitch.

‚û°Ô∏èThis warning is important. React uses a virtual DOM to represent the current appearance of your website. To efficiently render components created in a loop such as with map(), each component must have a unique key prop.

‚û°Ô∏èLuckily, our contacts.js objects have a unique id property. We use this as the key prop by setting key={contact.id} on each Card component. This resolves the warning as we conform to React's rules.
