-->A COMPONENTS in React is like a reusable building block for your user interface. 
    Think of it like a LEGO piece: you can build small parts (like a button or a header), 
    and then combine them to build a full app.

-->Functional Components are the most common use. This means that I can make a fucntion that will,
return something that I will use in the webapp as jxs. So I will have the funtion but I have also to,
export the function to use in the other file. I had to especify this like this:
--> export delfualt nameOftheFucntion;//Notice that I do not use the () as fucntion, buecause It will use as a fuciont there.

-->Generelay in the main fail JS file(index.js), I will call an App fucntion, that also will call other compoments.
For example in the App.jsx file I wil have to import other compoments by import them like this:
--> import Component(this is the name of the fucntion) from "./Component(this is the path of the file and I do not need to add the extetion jsx)" 

-->In the file that I will use the component I have that call it with a tag like this:
--> <Component /> //The name a space a slash in a open/close tag.

EXAMPLE of file extructure.

1-----index.js---
import React from "react"; //Import React to write JSX.
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; //To create the webapp.
import App from "./App"; //Import the App component.

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
//Just here I just will call the App component, that is the way and looks clean.

2-----App.jsx---
import React from "react"; //Import React to write JSX.
import H1 from "./H1"; //Import the H1 component.
import List from "./List"; //Import the List component.

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <H1 />
      <List />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App; //Export out side the function obviously.

3-----H1.jsx---
import React from "react"; //Import React to write JSX.

function H1() {
  return( 
  <h1>My Favourite Foods</h1>
  )
}
export default H1; //export out side the function obviously.

4-----List.jsx---
import React from "react"; //Always import React to write JSX.

function List() {
  return (
    //the fuciont will always return something.
    <ul>
      <li>Bacon</li>
      <li>Jamon</li>
      <li>Noodles</li>
    </ul>
  );
}
export default List; //Export out side the function obviously.
