--Js ES6--
Think of ES6 as the modern version of JavaScript — and React is built to take full advantage of it.

Key ES6 Features Used in React
Here are the most important ES6 features you’ll use constantly in React:

Feature	                      What It Does                 	              React Use Case Example

->let and const	                Block-scoped variables	                  Declare state or props
->Arrow functions	             Shorter function syntax	                  Define components or event handlers
->Template literals	            Embed variables in strings with ${}	      Dynamic JSX content
->Destructuring	                Extract values from objects/arrays	          Access props or state easily
->Modules (import/export)	    Split code into reusable files	              Import React, components, styles
->Classes	                    Blueprint for objects	                      (Older) class-based components
->Spread/rest ...	            Expand or collect values	                  Merge props, clone arrays
->Promises & async/await	    Handle asynchronous code	                  Fetch data from APIs

--What is the differecen between cosnt and let?--

-->const = constant → once you assign a value, it’s locked in.
-->let = flexible → you can change the value later.

--EXAMPLE--
//In this examples is explained the use of export/import for defualt const/function/s and when there are not defualt.

--index.js--
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import pi, { doublePi, triplePi } from "./math.js";

ReactDOM.render(
  <ul>
    <li>{pi}</li>
    <li>{doublePi()}</li>
    <li>{triplePi()}</li>
  </ul>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
//So here I discuss the use of "import" as I can see in the component math.js.
//That have more of one stuff to import, so in the math.js file It will be one and
//only one paramter as default in the export statement( expeort defult pi).
//But I can also export the other stuff like the other 2 function doublePi and triplePi.
//So in the top I have the correct way for=> import pi, {doublePi, triplePi} from "./matn.js"
//Also I can use  wild card * to import everything from math.js but this is not use.

--math.js--
const pi = 3.1415962;

function doublePi() {
  return pi * 2;
}

function triplePi() {
  return pi * 3;
}

export default pi;
export { doublePi, triplePi };
//Here I have the defult export and the specific export
//pi is a constnat in this case, and doublePi and triplePi are fuctions.
